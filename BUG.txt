Looking at the UseCard.kt file in line 65 the intent.type = "text/giftcards" was causing issues.
Part 4
Looking at the CardInterface, I noticed there was a vunerablitiy as it was not validating a string to the header, this can cuase issues, as without authentication people can manuplate the interface. 
something like this can help fix the error a bit better because it will match a workable string that will apply to this parameter. This will ensure that the correct gift card is being used for the correct user.

"fun isAuthorizationHeaderValid(authHeader: String?): Boolean {
    if (authHeader == null) {
        return false
    }
    val pattern = Pattern.compile(JWT_REGEX_PATTERN)
    val matcher = pattern.matcher(authHeader)
    return matcher.matches()
}"
